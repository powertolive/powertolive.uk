  <h1>Ms Tien Kuei</h1>
  <h2>Co-Founder and CEO</h2>
  <p>
    Tien specialises in ‘3rd wave’ CBT approaches, which focuses on
    compassionate yet precise behavioural focused treatments. Tien’s expertise
    are in Acceptance & Commitment therapy (ACT) and Functional Analytic
    Psychotherapy (FAP) and contributes to the clinical development of the FAP
    field as well as presents FAP training workshops for clinicians
    internationally.
  </p>
  <p>
    She has worked in both the primary care sector and with the Priory Hospital
    with adults across a variety of mental health and life issues. Tien is
    currently reading a PhD with the University of Glasgow researching the
    behavioural components of effective therapeutic relationship to foster
    change. She has worked as a research therapist for UCH/UCL in an ACT based
    RCT for terminal cancer patients.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tien experienced her first charity work with Commit and ACT, who offers ACT
    training to health workers in Sierra Leone (commitnandact.com). After
    visiting the country and seeing how effective behavioural treatments can
    translate across culture and used to strengthen communities, she wants to
    provide cutting-edge evidence-based CBT treatments to more people in the UK,
    by offering training in these skills to Power to Live Foundation therapists
    in order to provide behavioural treatments to our clients, as well as create
    communities to support change.

  <h1>Mr George Panayiotou</h1>
  <h2>Co-Founder and Director of Fundraising</h2>
  <p>
    George grew up with a mother who suffered from mental illnesses and it was
    something he hid for a while as it was always frowned upon. This was
    something he felt embarrassed of, but today this is the reason why he wants
    to help other people with the same issues and offer the support that he
    wished his mother could have had.
  </p>
  <p>
    George Panayiotou is a property investor and developer across a variety of
    asset classes from residential, hotel, commercial and leisure. With an
    investment and long term strategy in place to grow and create, not only key
    businesses and new start-ups, George also wanted to create something
    meaningful through The Power to Live Foundation. This is something very
    close to George’s heart as he recognises the most powerful tool you have in
    life is your mind, and mastering how to control your mind in situations that
    can challenge you, in business as well as personally.
  </p>
  <p>
    George is a key fund-raiser and donor helping us to offer evidence-based
    psychotherapy to more people without the means to access them. He is also
    passionate about building supportive communities that can help people shape
    their mind-set which in term will assist people to shape their future.
