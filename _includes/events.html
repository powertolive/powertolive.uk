      Our social connection group has started! Everyoneâ€™s welcome!
    </p>
    <p>
      We have joined with
      <a href="https://www.livewithacl.org/what-we-do/" target="_blank"
        >Live with Awareness, Courage and Love Global Project</a
      >
      (ACL) to help people develop the social connections they desire by using
      empirically supported exercises to help us connect to each other with
      Awareness, Courage and Love.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our ACL meetings, we facilitate exercises that allow us to experience,
      practice, and balance these principles in real interactions.
