        Power to Live is committed to providing equal opportunities for everyone
        and we actively encourage applications from all sections of the
        community.

      <p>
        Regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity,
        marital status, pregnancy, race, religion or belief, applicants will be
        considered based on their abilities, qualifications, and Power to Live’s
        business needs. We are continuously working to improve the diversity of
        our workforce and we strive to provide an inclusive working environment
        where people feel respected and supported in fulfilling their
        potential.  As we want to reflect the diversity of the communities we
        work in, we particularly encourage applications from male candidates,
        alongside candidates who are 50+, or from Black, Asian, and Minority
        Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds.
