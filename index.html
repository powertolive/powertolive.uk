          <p>
            When people struggle with life alone over a long time, not knowing
            how to help themselves manage emotional pain nor have people around
            them to ask for help, we can end up with chronic stress, trauma,
            anxiety and depression.

        <p>
          We struggle more when we feel stuck in pain and out of control. We
          stay in suffering when we don’t know how to help ourselves, don’t know
          how to ask or receive help, or don’t have the support we need around
          us.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are struggling with chronic stress, anxiety and depression or
          are living with a traumatic experience, we can help you. We provide a

              If we are concerned for your safety or identify any risk to
              yourself or others at any time during your treatment, we may
              contact your GP or other relevant services as we would have a duty
              of care to do so. Where possible the reasons for this would be
              discussed with you, but this may not always be possible.
