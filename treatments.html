					<h2>Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP)</h2>

					<div class="content">
						<p>FAP treatment uses the secure base of an intense and compassionate therapeutic relationship to foster client growth. The therapist is always exquisitely sensitive to clients’ behaviour and compassionately shapes the client towards pursuing their life-values. This approach is grounded in precise behavioral science that focuses on in-session behaviors to create effective behavioral change. This interpersonal approach supercharges all other treatments and is recommended for clients with patterns of relationship issues.</p>

						<p>The tenets of FAP are ‘Awareness, Courage and therapeutic Love’. It is an intense curative experience which empowers the client to courageously step into their own life with more harmony and build deeper interpersonal connections.</p>

					<h2>Acceptance And Commitment Therapy (ACT)</h2>

					<div class="content">
						<p>This is the latest development of psychological therapy which recognizes that the more we fight a problem, the worse it gets. Rather than focusing on our symptoms, it treats the core of the issue, which is usually the non-acceptance of our pain. When we reject our pain and focus all our energy on getting rid of it, we lose sight of how we want to live well.</p>

						<p>Acceptance and commitment therapy is all about what we do in life. It is about accepting our pain and committing to activities that are in line with what we value in order to live a meaningful life.</p>

						<p>The treatment involves: Teaching you psychological skills to deal with your painful thoughts and feelings effectively – in such a way that they have much less impact and influence over you. (These are known as mindfulness skills.)</p>
						<p>Helping you to clarify what is truly important and meaningful to you  – i.e. your values – then use that knowledge to guide, inspire and motivate you to change your life for the better.</p>

					<h2>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)</h2>

					<div class="content">
						<p>CBT is a clinically and research proven breakthrough in mental health care. Behaviour therapy helps you weaken and break the connections between stress-inducing situations and your habitual reactions to them; reactions such as fear, depression or rage, and self-defeating or self-damaging behaviour.</p>

						<p>It also teaches you how to calm your mind and body, so you can feel better, think more clearly, and make better decisions.</p>

						<p>Cognitive therapy teaches you how certain thinking patterns are causing your symptoms – by giving you a distorted picture of what’s going on in your life, and making you feel anxious, depressed or angry for no good reason, or provoking you into self-destructive or sabotaging actions.</p>

						<p>When combined into CBT, behaviour therapy and cognitive therapy provide you with very powerful tools for stopping your symptoms and getting your life on a more satisfying track.</p>
