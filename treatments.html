        To make an appointment you need to come with a referral letter from your

        We will also need evidence of income status for you to access the

        allocate you to a treatment therapist.

        Sadly we do not have the appropriate team and medical capacity to treat
        people who are: actively suicidal, experiencing psychotic symptoms,
        chronic eating disorders and addiction issues.

      <h2>Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP)</h2>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          FAP treatment uses the secure base of an intense and compassionate
          therapeutic relationship to foster client growth. The therapist is
          always exquisitely sensitive to clients’ behaviour and compassionately
          shapes the client towards pursuing their life-values. This approach is
          grounded in precise behavioral science that focuses on in-session
          behaviors to create effective behavioral change. This interpersonal
          approach supercharges all other treatments and is recommended for
          clients with patterns of relationship issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tenets of FAP are ‘Awareness, Courage and therapeutic Love’. It is
          an intense curative experience which empowers the client to
          courageously step into their own life with more harmony and build
          deeper interpersonal connections.

      <h2>Acceptance And Commitment Therapy (ACT)</h2>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          This is the latest development of psychological therapy which
          recognizes that the more we fight a problem, the worse it gets. Rather
          than focusing on our symptoms, it treats the core of the issue, which
          is usually the non-acceptance of our pain. When we reject our pain and
          focus all our energy on getting rid of it, we lose sight of how we
          want to live well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Acceptance and commitment therapy is all about what we do in life. It
          is about accepting our pain and committing to activities that are in
          line with what we value in order to live a meaningful life.
        </p>

        <p>
          The treatment involves: Teaching you psychological skills to deal with
          your painful thoughts and feelings effectively – in such a way that
          they have much less impact and influence over you. (These are known as
          mindfulness skills.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Helping you to clarify what is truly important and meaningful to you –
          i.e. your values – then use that knowledge to guide, inspire and
          motivate you to change your life for the better.
        </p>

      <h2>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)</h2>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          CBT is a clinically and research proven breakthrough in mental health
          care. Behaviour therapy helps you weaken and break the connections
          between stress-inducing situations and your habitual reactions to
          them; reactions such as fear, depression or rage, and self-defeating
          or self-damaging behaviour.
        </p>

        <p>
          It also teaches you how to calm your mind and body, so you can feel
          better, think more clearly, and make better decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cognitive therapy teaches you how certain thinking patterns are
          causing your symptoms – by giving you a distorted picture of what’s
          going on in your life, and making you feel anxious, depressed or angry
          for no good reason, or provoking you into self-destructive or
          sabotaging actions.
        </p>

        <p>
          When combined into CBT, behaviour therapy and cognitive therapy
          provide you with very powerful tools for stopping your symptoms and
          getting your life on a more satisfying track.
